# TestTaskInforce
The Test Cases and AutoTests 
F# Cypress AutoTests Setup and Execution Guide

This guide will help you set up and run automated tests using Cypress and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (with npm)
- Git

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krisvintse/TestTaskInforce
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running Tests

To run the automated tests, follow these steps:

1. Open Cypress:

    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```

2. Cypress Test Runner will open. Click on the test file you want to run (e.g., `example_spec.js`).

3. Cypress will launch a browser and execute the tests. You can see the test execution in the browser window.

4. Once the tests are completed, Cypress will display the test results in its Test Runner interface.

## Writing Tests

Tests in Cypress are written using JavaScript. You can find example test files in the `cypress/integration` directory. To create new tests:

1. Create a new JavaScript file in the `cypress/integration` directory.

2. Write your test using Cypress commands. Refer to the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html) for guidance on writing tests.

3. Save the file with a `.spec.js` extension (e.g., `my_test.spec.js`).

4. Run the tests using the Cypress Test Runner.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the tests, ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that your environment meets the prerequisites. You can also refer to the Cypress documentation or community forums for assistance.
